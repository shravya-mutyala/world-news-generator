The tax was scheduled to take effect Monday and would have applied retroactively, creating an estimated $2 billion bill for American companies.The conflict escalated rapidly after Canada\\'s Finance Department confirmed Friday that companies would still be required to make their first digital tax payments Monday, despite ongoing negotiations. The tax targeted revenue generated from Canadian users rather than corporate profits, making it particularly burdensome for technology companies operating internationally.Trump\\'s response was immediate and severe. He announced the suspension of all trade discussions \"effective immediately\" and threatened to impose new tariffs on Canadian goods within seven days. The president criticized Canada as \"a very difficult Country to TRADE with\" and described the digital tax as \"a direct and blatant attack on our Country.\"The dispute has unfolded against already strained U.S.-Canada relations. Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly criticized Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state. These tensions contributed to the political environment that led to Justin Trudeau\\'s resignation and Mark Carney\\'s subsequent election on an anti-Trump platform.Canada\\'s decision to rescind the tax came \"in anticipation\" of reaching a broader trade agreement, according to government officials.What People Are SayingCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday: Canada will \"continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interests of Canadians. It\\'s a negotiation.\"President Donald Trump previously said in the Oval Office that he expected Canada to lift the digital services tax: \"Economically we have such power over Canada. We\\'d rather not use it. It\\'s not going to work out well for Canada. They were foolish to do it.\"What Happens NextWith negotiations resuming, both countries will likely focus on addressing broader trade issues beyond the digital services tax.The Trump administration has indicated expectations for additional Canadian concessions, particularly regarding agricultural tariffs that have been a longstanding source of friction.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.', 'title': 'Canada and US Trade Talks Resume After Digital Tax Reversal', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 03:12:27', 'url': 'https://www.newsweek.com/canada-us-trade-talks-resume-digital-tax-reversal-2092304', 'authors': ['Adeola Adeosun']}, {'summary': 'Just hours before Canada’s new Digital Services Tax was set to go into effect, the Canadian government announced that it rescinded the levy &#8220;in anticipation of a mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States.&#8221; Canada scrapped the Digital Services Tax after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday had blasted Canada&#8217;s 3% Digital Services [&#8230;]', 'image': 'https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Canadian-PM-Mark-Carney-Donald-Trump.jpg', 'author': 'Todd Spangler', 'id': 336574834, 'text': 'Just hours before Canada’s new Digital Services Tax was set to go into effect, the Canadian government announced that it has rescinded the levy “in anticipation of a mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States.” Canada backed off from the Digital Services Tax after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday had blasted Canada’s […]', 'title': 'Canada Drops Digital Services Tax at 11th Hour, Backing Down After Trump Terminated Trade Talks Over the Issue', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 05:09:19', 'url': 'https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/canada-rescinds-digital-services-tax-trump-trade-talks-1236443840/', 'authors': ['Todd Spangler']}, {'summary': 'Canada is expected to resume trade talks with the U.S. after the Canadian government said late Sunday it was rescinding a digital services tax on American tech companies.', 'image': 'https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/06/trump-mark-carney-canada-pm-reuters.jpg', 'author': 'Bradford Betz', 'id': 336580588, 'text': 'Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will resume trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump after Canada said late Sunday it was rescinding a digital services tax on American tech companies.

Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Trump said the administration will inform Canada within the \"next seven day period\" of what tariff it will pay to do business with the U.S. The president added in his post that Canada is \"a very difficult Country to TRADE with\" and claimed that Canada has levied tariffs of up to 400% on U.S. dairy products. The breakdown in trade talks followed the two leaders’ G7 meeting early this month, and Carney saying they had agreed to wrap up a new economic agreement within 30 days. The U.S. is Canada&apos;s largest trading partner, while Canada is the largest importer of American exports and one of the top three sources of U.S. imports.

That kept Smith as part of a young corps with Alperen Sengun, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Cam Whitmore, and Reed Sheppard who will now go into next season alongside Durant and Fred VanVleet, who, per Charania last week, has also re-signed on what is a two-year, $50 million deal. The Rockets also signed head coach Ime Udoka to an extension after his second season in Houston, per Charania. Altogether, it’s clear that this is the team that Houston wants to take into the next few seasons based on their moves in June.\\n\\nSmith hasn’t yet fully lived up to his pedigree as a top-three pick, especially compared to those drafted ahead of him: Paolo Banchero and Chet Holmgren. That said, the Rockets must think that development is still coming for Smith, and locked him up to be part of their future in Houston.', 'title': 'Report: Houston Rockets signing Jabari Smith Jr. to five-year, $122 million rookie extension', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 01:24:52', 'url': 'https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/report_houston_rockets_signing_jabari_smith_jr_to_five_year_122_million_rookie_extension/s1_17236_42393250', 'authors': ['5 GOATs', 'Sam Gillenwater']}, {'summary': 'The Houston Rockets&#8217; offseason continues to get better as rising star Jabari Smith Jr. will commit to them in the long term.

But those names need to be tabled for the moment with all-in pursuit of Ayton.\\nAyton’s career hasn’t quite gone as expected after the Phoenix Suns made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. Following a top-three finish in the 2019 Rookie of the Year race, his career has sort of been underwhelming so to speak. His availability has played a role in that, with him only playing an average 55 games per year over the past four seasons.\\nBut there’s no question that Ayton has proven that he is a gifted scorer in the NBA. He holds career averages of 16.4 points and 59 percent shooting across his seven seasons. He is a strong presence on the glass, averaging double digits in rebounding every season of his career.\\nAyton is mobile and a lob threat, something that is a requirement playing alongside Luka Doncic. And perhaps one factor that could potentially give the Lakers a leg up in pursuing him? Ayton and Doncic share the same agent in Bill Duffy.\\nWith the exception of seven games during his first two seasons, Ayton has been a starting center. The Lakers front office was officially put on the clock following comments made by LeBron James’ agent Rich Paul amid James opting into his contract for next season.\\nThe Lakers will certainly have competition from other teams should they enter the race to sign Ayton. His talent is undeniable. But the Lakers offer him a situation much to his advantage. One, he gets a prime opportunity to boost his stock again with plenty of minutes available at center. Two, he gets to play alongside perhaps the absolute best running mate for a big man in Doncic. And three, the Lakers need to be in win-now mode as laid out by James and Paul.\\nPlaying on a winning team making a big impact is exactly what Ayton needs. And the Lakers are certainly in need of his talent.', 'title': 'Why Lakers must pursue Deandre Ayton in free agency after Blazers buyout', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 03:33:33', 'url': 'https://clutchpoints.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/lakers-pursue-deandre-ayton-free-agency-blazers-buyout', 'authors': ['David Yapkowitz']}, {'summary': 'The Portland Trail Blazers made a big and surprising move before free agency begins, as they came to an agreement on a buyout with one of their centers, according to ESPN&#8217;s Shams Charania. &#8220;Breaking: Deandre Ayton is finalizing a contract buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers to become a free agent, sources tell ESPN,&#8221; Charania [&#8230;]\\n\\n\\nThe post Deandre Ayton becomes top free agent center after Blazers contract buyout appeared first on ClutchPoints.', 'image': 'https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Deandre-Ayton-becomes-top-free-agent-center-after-Blazers-contract-buyout.jpg', 'author': 'Malik Brown', 'id': 336624212, 'text': 'The Portland Trail Blazers made a big and surprising move before free agency begins, as they came to an agreement on a buyout with one of their centers, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.\\n“Breaking: Deandre Ayton is finalizing a contract buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers to become a free agent, sources tell ESPN,” Charania wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\\n“Sudden addition to the free-agent market. This gives Ayton, a former No. 1 overall pick who went to the NBA Finals with the Suns, the chance to receive a fresh opportunity as the Trail Blazers build around their depth of young centers,” Charania continued.\\nIt will be interesting to see what Ayton’s market will be as free agency is on the way.\\nThere were many questions on how the Blazers would handle their center rotation, especially after drafting Hansen Yang with the No. 16 pick in the NBA Draft. Not many people expected Yang to go that quickly in the draft, but the Blazers believed in his talent. In his two seasons with the Chinese Basketball Association, Yang averaged 15.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks while shooting 56.9 percent from the field.\\nThe Blazers had four centers on the roster, which included Ayton, Donovan Clingan, and Robert Williams III. There was a good chance someone would be on the outside looking in, and it was Ayton whom the Blazers decided to let go.\\nAyton’s game has been under a microscope over the past few seasons, and it started during his final season with the Phoenix Suns. Since coming to the Trail Blazers, Ayton hadn’t been available to play much, which gave other players on the team a chance to get minutes.\\nIn Clingan’s rookie season last year, he took advantage of the opportunity, and he averaged 6.5 points and 7.9 rebounds in 67 games.\\nAyton will most likely have a list of suitors going after him, and he may be signed sooner rather than later.', 'title': 'Deandre Ayton becomes top free agent center after Blazers contract buyout', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 02:47:12', 'url': 'https://clutchpoints.com/nba/portland-trail-blazers/blazers-news-deandre-ayton-becomes-free-agent-center-portland-contract-buyout', 'authors': ['Malik Brown']}]}",

You\\'ll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you\\'re wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you\\'ll see which ones you\\'ve got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn\\'t in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you\\'ve got the right letter in the right spot.\\nYour second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn\\'t present in today\\'s answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.\\nAfter that, it\\'s just a case of using what you\\'ve learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there\\'s an E). Don\\'t forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you\\'d like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above.\\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn\\'t long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it\\'s only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.\\n\\nKerry Brunskill\\n\\nSocial Links Navigation\\nContributing Writer\\n\\nWhen baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn\\'t do.

He finished second on the team with 57 points.\\n\\nWhile some have questioned whether Geekie can replicate that kind of goal scoring because of his unusually high shooting percentage (22%), he does have an excellent shot, both a wrister and one-time slap shot. After notching a career-high in goals with 17 in his first season with the Bruins in 2023-24, he caught fire after Thanksgiving last season after a very slow start that saw him as a healthy scratch several times early in the season.\\n\\nThe Geekie signing could turn out to be one of the great finds of GM Don Sweeney’s tenure. Just two summers ago, he was cast aside by the Seattle Kraken, who did not tender him a qualifying offer, thus making him an unrestricted free agent. The B’s scooped him up with a two-year deal worth $2 million per season.\\n\\nLess than a week ago, it appeared as though this negotiation might take a while. Last Wednesday, Sweeney said that the two sides were not close to a deal. But things happen fast this time of year. Geekie was scheduled to be a restricted free agent and thus could have been exposed to an offer sheet, which no doubt played a part in pushing to get this done before the start of free agency on Tuesday.\\n\\nAccording to puckpedia.com, the breakdown of the deal is as follows: Year 1, $2.75 million base salary, $2.5 million signing bonus; Year 2, $4 million base $2.5 million signing bonus and a no-trade clause kicks in; Year 3, $4.5 million base, $2 million signing bonus, 17-team NTC; Year 4, $4.5 million base, $1 million bonus, 12-team NTC; Year 5, $5 million base, 6-team NTC; Year 6, $4.25 million.\\n\\nThere is also late word that RFA John Beecher, the B’s first-round pick in 2019 (30th overall), will also return for at least another year, though the details of his deal are not yet known.', 'title': 'Bruins sign Morgan Geekie to a six-year extension', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 03:09:03', 'url': 'https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/29/bruins-sign-morgan-geekie-to-a-six-year-extension/', 'authors': ['Steve Conroy']}, {'summary': 'The Boston Bruins have re-signed pending restricted free agent Morgan Geekie to a six-year contract carrying an average annual value of $5,500,000.

He signed a two-year contract on July 1st, 2023, worth $2,000,000 annually.\\n\\nDrafted in the third round (67th overall) by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, Geekie found himself splitting time between the American Hockey League (AHL) and the National Hockey League (NHL) throughout his first three seasons.\\n\\nHe would go on to be a part of the Charlotte Checkers, who won the 2019 AHL Calder Cup, and spend the following season with Charlotte before finally getting a look in the NHL.\\n\\nGeekie was one of the expansion draft selections by the Seattle Kraken, and he seemed to find his footing as a bottom-six forward. However, Seattle chose not to extend him a qualifying offer, and he found his current landing spot with the Boston Bruins, consistently posting career highs.\\n\\nIn the 2024-25 season, Geekie posted career highs in games played (77), goals (33), assists (24), and points (57). To date, Geekie’s posted 159 points (72G, 87A) in 333 career NHL games. He’s also suited up for 37 career playoff games, posting 10 points (6G,4A) in that time.\\n\\nBefore Geekie’s professional career, he played two games of Junior A hockey for the Neepawa Natives of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) and five seasons of Major Junior hockey for the Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League.\\n\\nThe Strathclair, Manitoba-born center will look to build off his strong season with the Boston Bruins. Geekie will be 32 when the contract expires at the end of the 2030-31 season.\\n\\nLocking up Geekie long-term adds to the center depth the Bruins are building, and also shows the commitment level the team has in the player and vice versa. Geekie outperformed his previous contract and is more than deserving of his current deal.\\n\\nThis was Morgan Geekie’s final year as an RFA, giving the Bruins five years of club control with the agreement. General Manager Don Sweeney will utilize the remaining $16.6 million in cap space to fill other needs as the Bruins eye another playoff appearance after missing the postseason for the first time since the 2015-16 season.', 'title': 'Morgan Geekie Inks Six-Year Extension in Boston', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 03:10:05', 'url': 'https://www.yardbarker.com/nhl/articles/morgan_geekie_inks_six_year_extension_in_boston/s1_17352_42393434', 'authors': ['Conrad Jack', 'Inside The Rink']}, {'summary': 'The Boston Bruins have signed pending restricted free agent center Morgan Geekie to a six-year contract extension that carries a $5.5-million average annual value, reports TSN’s Chris Johnston.', 'image': 'https://www.yardbarker.com/media/d/d/dd190be3424e3d74a80541e797809a1e7edf3d12/thumb_16x9/USATSI_25858112-1-scaled.jpg', 'author': 'Cory Wilkins,Daily Faceoff', 'id': 336607012, 'text': 'The Boston Bruins have signed pending restricted free agent center Morgan Geekie to a six-year contract extension that carries a $5.5-million average annual value, reports TSN’s Chris Johnston.\\n\\nThrough 77 appearances with the Bruins last season, Geekie tallied 33 goals and 24 assists for 57 points, putting him second in team scoring. With it, Geekie also registered 22 penalty minutes and a plus-three rating.\\n\\nOriginally chosen by the Carolina Hurricanes in the third round of the 2017 NHL Draft, the 26-year-old native of Strathclair, Man., has since skated in 333 career contests with the Hurricanes, Seattle Kraken, and Bruins in which he has tallied 72 goals and 87 assists for 159 points. In two seasons with the Bruins, Geekie has posted back-to-back career-best showings, counting 39 points in 2023-24 and last year’s 57-point effort. Geekie’s career stat line also counts six goals and four assists for 10 points through 37 outings in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\\n\\nPer PuckPedia, Geekie was in the final year of a two-year pact worth $2 million per season. Geekie originally joined the Bruins in the 2023 offseason as an unrestricted free agent after he did not receive a qualifying offer from the Kraken.\\n\\nBeyond his success in the NHL, Geekie has also skated in part of three seasons in the AHL where through 130 career contests he has collected 45 goals and 48 assists for 93 points, underscored by a Calder Cup win with the Charlotte Checkers during the 2018-19 campaign where en route to the championship he put up eight goals and 10 assists for 18 points in 19 playoff outings.\\n\\nGeekie rejoins a Bruins squad that closed out the 2024-25 season second-to-last in the Eastern Conference with a 33-39-10 record and 75 points, marking the first time since 2016 in which the club did not qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.', 'title': 'Report: Bruins sign Morgan Geekie to six-year, $33-million contract extension', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 02:40:33', 'url': 'https://www.yardbarker.com/nhl/articles/report_bruins_sign_morgan_geekie_to_six_year_33_million_contract_extension/s1_16958_42393475', 'authors': ['Cory Wilkins', 'Daily Faceoff']}]}",

The vastly experienced 38-year-old has reached the third round on seven occasions and has a wonderful single-handed backhand and slice that sticks low to the grass and prevents opponents from getting on top of the ball and hitting through the court. He troubled Andy Murray at SW19 a few years ago and will hope to get inside Alcaraz's head.\\nAlcaraz could have been forgiven for a slow start to the grass court season after his stunning French Open exertions but the Spaniard won Queen's as he goes for a hat-trick of Wimbledon titles. The 22-year-old knows how it feels to open Center Court on the tournament's opening day and will want to put on a show against a man he's beaten in their two previous meetings.

Riley Greene contributed with his 19th home run of the year, leading off the fifth with another homer off Twins starter Chris Paddack.\\nThe Tigers improved to 53-32 with the win, having won 19 of 27 series and holding a 30-14 record at home. Detroit’s bullpen sealed the shutout, with Tommy Kahnle and Will Vest each tossing a scoreless inning and Vest earning his 13th save of the season.\\nDetroit now heads into a six-game road trip beginning Tuesday against the Washington Nationals.', 'title': 'Tarik Skubal makes Tigers history in dominant Twins outing', 'publish_date': '2025-06-30 03:55:20', 'url': 'https://clutchpoints.com/mlb/detroit-tigers/tigers-news-tarik-skubal-detroit-history-dominant-twins-outing', 'authors': ['Abdullah Imran']}]}",

         "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said late Sunday trade talks with U.S. have resumed after Canada rescinded its plan to tax U.S. technology firms.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called “a direct and blatant attack on our country.”\n\nThe Canadian government said “in anticipation” of a trade deal “Canada would rescind” the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.\n\nCarney and Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney’s office said they agreed to resume negotiations.\n\n“Today’s announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month’s G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis,” Carney said in a statement.\n\nCarney visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but firm. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.\n\nTrump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.\n\nThe digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.\n\nDaniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a “clear victory\" for Trump.\n\n\"At some point this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,\" Béland said.\n\nHe said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump’s outbursts.\n\n“President Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executive will be very happy with this outcome,” Béland said.\n\nCanadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday.\n\n“Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,” Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.\n\nTrump’s announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he’s launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the U.S. president poking at the nation’s northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.\n\nCanada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Trump imposed on goods from America’s neighbor.\n\nTrump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period he set would expire.\n\nCanada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump’s first term.",

         "Canada and the United States have resumed trade negotiations after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to rescind the country's digital services tax on U.S. technology companies.The development follows President Donald Trump's announcement on Friday that he was suspending all trade talks with Canada \"effective immediately\" over the tax policy.Why It MattersTrump's Friday announcement followed Canada's confirmation that it would proceed with its digital services tax on technology giants, most of which are U.S.-based, despite a previous G7 agreement where the Trump administration had agreed to drop a retaliatory tax proposal from congressional consideration.Canada's quick reversal signals the high stakes involved in maintaining trade relationships with the United States, particularly given the countries' deeply integrated economies.What To KnowCarney's office confirmed on Sunday that both leaders have agreed to restart negotiations after Canada committed to abandoning the 3 percent levy targeting major U.S. tech giants including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber, and Airbnb. The tax was scheduled to take effect Monday and would have applied retroactively, creating an estimated $2 billion bill for American companies.The conflict escalated rapidly after Canada's Finance Department confirmed Friday that companies would still be required to make their first digital tax payments Monday, despite ongoing negotiations. The tax targeted revenue generated from Canadian users rather than corporate profits, making it particularly burdensome for technology companies operating internationally.Trump's response was immediate and severe. He announced the suspension of all trade discussions \"effective immediately\" and threatened to impose new tariffs on Canadian goods within seven days. The president criticized Canada as \"a very difficult Country to TRADE with\" and described the digital tax as \"a direct and blatant attack on our Country.\"The dispute has unfolded against already strained U.S.-Canada relations. Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly criticized Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state. These tensions contributed to the political environment that led to Justin Trudeau's resignation and Mark Carney's subsequent election on an anti-Trump platform.Canada's decision to rescind the tax came \"in anticipation\" of reaching a broader trade agreement, according to government officials.What People Are SayingCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday: Canada will \"continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interests of Canadians. It's a negotiation.\"President Donald Trump previously said in the Oval Office that he expected Canada to lift the digital services tax: \"Economically we have such power over Canada. We'd rather not use it. It's not going to work out well for Canada. They were foolish to do it.\"What Happens NextWith negotiations resuming, both countries will likely focus on addressing broader trade issues beyond the digital services tax.The Trump administration has indicated expectations for additional Canadian concessions, particularly regarding agricultural tariffs that have been a longstanding source of friction.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.",

CRITICS SAY SOCIALIST MAYORAL FRONTRUNNER THREATENS NYC&apos;S ECONOMIC CAPITAL Canada&apos;s digital services tax took effect in June 2024 and requires large businesses, whether they&apos;re headquartered in Canada or elsewhere, to pay a 3% tax on revenue earned from engaging with online users in Canada if they meet certain conditions. Trump terminated trade discussions with Canada on Friday, citing the digital services tax on American tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google, and Apple, among others, as the reason.

Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Trump said the administration will inform Canada within the \"next seven day period\" of what tariff it will pay to do business with the U.S. The president added in his post that Canada is \"a very difficult Country to TRADE with\" and claimed that Canada has levied tariffs of up to 400% on U.S. dairy products. The breakdown in trade talks followed the two leaders’ G7 meeting early this month, and Carney saying they had agreed to wrap up a new economic agreement within 30 days. The U.S. is Canada&apos;s largest trading partner, while Canada is the largest importer of American exports and one of the top three sources of U.S. imports.

         "TORONTO — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said late Sunday trade talks with U.S. have resumed after Canada rescinded its plan to tax U.S. technology firms.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called \"a direct and blatant attack on our country.\"\n\nThe Canadian government said \"in anticipation\" of a trade deal \"Canada would rescind\" the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.\n\nCarney and Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume negotiations.\n\n\"Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,\" Carney said in a statement.\n\nCarney visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but firm. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.\n\nTrump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.\n\nThe digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.\n\nDaniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a \"clear victory\" for Trump.\n\n\"At some point this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,\" Béland said.\n\nHe said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump's outbursts.\n\n\"President Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executive will be very happy with this outcome,\" Béland said.\n\nCanadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday.\n\n\"Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,\" Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.\n\nTrump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the U.S. president poking at the nation's northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.\n\nCanada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Trump imposed on goods from America's neighbor.\n\nTrump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period he set would expire.\n\nCanada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump's first term.",

         "June 30 (UPI) -- Ottawa announced late Sunday that it was rescinding a tax on technology firms generating revenue from Canadians just hours before it was to take effect, in an effort to move forward trade negotiations with the United States.\n\nOttawa's Department of Finance announced in a statement that because they were scrapping the Digital Services Tax, Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to resume trade negotiations with the goal of signing a deal by July 21.\n\n\"Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress and reinforce our work to create jobs and build prosperity for all Canadians,\" Minister of Finance and National Revenue Francois-Philippe Champagne said.\n\nAnnounced in 2020, the Digital Services Tax sought to ensure domestic and foreign companies profiting off Canadians online were paying taxes on that revenue. According to Ottawa, it levied a 3% tax on revenue earned from certain digital services that rely on the engagement data and content of Canadian users as well as certain sales of Canadian user data.\n\nCompanies to be affected were online market place and advertising services as well as social media companies, including Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta.\n\nThe tax was to take effect Monday, amid ongoing trade negotiations between Canada and the United States.\n\nHowever, Trump on Friday unilaterally called the talks off after being informed American technology companies would be hit with the 3% tax, which he described as \"a direct and blatant attack on our Country.\"\n\n\"Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform, while stating he will inform Ottawa within seven days of \"the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America.\"\n\nTrump has yet to comment on the latest announcement.\n\nTo rescind the tax, it will require legislative approval, so in the meantime Ottawa said it will halt collection.\n\nRelations between the United States and Canada have deteriorated under the second Trump administration due to Trump's trade war.\n\nTrump has imposed a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports not subjected to the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, as well as a 10% tariff on energy products, a 25% tariff on all cars and trucks built north of the border and a 50% tariff on aluminum and steel imports.\n\nCanada has responded with a slew of tariffs of its own, including a 25% levy on certain goods from the United States.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney, whose Liberal Party won a minority government in Parliament in late April, campaigned on standing up against Trump, while referring to the Ottawa-Washington relationship as having been changed and the U.S. tariffs as a \"betrayal.\"\n\nAmid the tariff fight, Carney has sought to strengthen other relationships while lessening Canada's trade and security dependence on the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Canada and the European Union agreed to deepen their security and defense relationship as they launch negotiations across multiple areas, from digital policy to climate.",

These moves illustrate a team that is going all-in for the 2025-26 season. \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Houston Rockets are set to answer next season with championship aspirations. Locking up Smith Jr. is a shrewd move by the organization. He is a solid player but must improve his offensive game to reach his full potential. Getting to learn from a historic scorer like Durant, will help the young player in that department. Smith Jr. may also have to adapt to a bench role. Durant is expected to start at the power forward position. That is not a negative for the team. The young power forward will give Houston one of the best sixth men in the National Basketball Association.",

He’ll now get the chance to continue that with the franchise that drafted the Auburn alum, avoiding free agency in the process.\n\nPer ESPN’s Shams Charania, the Houston Rockets will be signing Smith to a rookie extension worth five-years, $122 million. That’ll keep him as part of the team through the start of the next decade in 2030-2031.\n\n“Houston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr. intends to sign a five-year, $122 million rookie contract extension, sources tell ESPN,” Charania tweeted tonight. “Rockets officials and Smith’s agent, Wallace Prather of LIFT Sports Management, negotiated the fully guaranteed deal through 2030-31 season.”\n\nSmith has averaged 13 points (43.2% FG, 34% 3PT), 7.5 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game through three seasons with Houston. After an improved second season, those stats took a dip this past season to 12.2 points (43.8% FG, 35.4% 3PT), 7.0 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. Part of that was injuries, namely a fracture in his left hand, as Smith only played in 57 games as the Rockets went 52-30 overall and finished as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference.\n\nNow, based on some of their other moves so far this offseason, Houston clearly sees Smith as a key part of their future. The Rockets didn’t include him as part of the trade package for Kevin Durant in their deal with Phoenix, instead sending out Jalen Green along with Dillon Brooks. That kept Smith as part of a young corps with Alperen Sengun, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Cam Whitmore, and Reed Sheppard who will now go into next season alongside Durant and Fred VanVleet, who, per Charania last week, has also re-signed on what is a two-year, $50 million deal. The Rockets also signed head coach Ime Udoka to an extension after his second season in Houston, per Charania. Altogether, it’s clear that this is the team that Houston wants to take into the next few seasons based on their moves in June.\n\nSmith hasn’t yet fully lived up to his pedigree as a top-three pick, especially compared to those drafted ahead of him: Paolo Banchero and Chet Holmgren. That said, the Rockets must think that development is still coming for Smith, and locked him up to be part of their future in Houston.",

         "HOUSTON – The Houston Rockets have locked up a key piece of their future, as Jabari Smith Jr. will sign a five-year, $122 million extension. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the fully guaranteed deal ties Smith to Houston through the 2030-31 season. Jabari Smith Jr’s extension signals the Rockets’ firm belief in the 22-year-old’s potential to anchor their forward rotation for years to come. Smith had a $12.4 million club option for 2025-26 but will decline that in favor of long-term security. The Rockets know they have a young star in Smith and made the right choice to keep him.\n\nJabari Smith Jr’s $122 Million Extension Lets Rockets Stay Greedy\n\nInjuries Didn’t Deter Rockets’ Faith\n\nLast season, Smith opened strong, averaging 11.9 points and 6.5 rebounds in his first 33 games. However, a broken left hand during a shootaround forced him out for 22 games. After returning on February 21, he bounced between the starting five and the bench. He closed the regular season averaging 12.2 points and 7 rebounds in 57 games, starting 39.\n\nJabari Smith Jr’s extension shows the Rockets trust that he can take a bigger role next season. The Athletic’s Kelly Iko and Sam Amick confirmed that Smith is expected to move back into the starting unit after the blockbuster Kevin Durant trade.\n\nPlayoff Learning Curve\n\nHouston’s playoff run ended in the first round, but it marked growth. Smith contributed 7.4 points per game in seven playoff appearances. Though the numbers dipped, the experience will fuel his development. He’s ready to help lead this group further next time\n\nSmith’s shooting did regress slightly during an injury-plagued year, but the Rockets believe he can find his rhythm again. If healthy, his fourth NBA season could cement him as a reliable two-way forward.\n\nImpressive Start to Career\n\nDrafted third overall in 2022, Smith made the All-Rookie Second Team. He averaged 12.8 points and 7.2 rebounds that season. He also became the second rookie in NBA history to record 550 rebounds and 100 threes in one season.\n\nThrough three seasons, Smith stands alone from his draft class with 2,500 career points and 1,500 rebounds. Jabari Smith Jr’s extension underscores the Rockets’ faith that he can raise those numbers much higher.\n\nExtension Fits Bigger Ambitions",

         "A gunman ambushed and shot dead two firefighters responding to a forest fire in the US state of Idaho on Monday, wounding one other during an hours-long incident before the suspect was found dead, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nLaw enforcement officers and firefighters took sniper fire during the incident at Canfield Mountain, a nature zone popular with hikers near Coeur d’Alene, about 420km east of Seattle, sheriff Bob Norris said.\n\n“We do believe that the suspect started the fire,” Norris told a press conference. “This was a total ambush. These firefighters did not have a chance.”\n\nA third wounded firefighter was “fighting for his life” after surgery and was in a stable condition, Norris added.\n\nThe motive for the shooting was not known and Norris did not provide any details on the suspect, saying officers were still working to identify the man.\n\nMore than 300 law enforcement officers from the city, county, state and federal levels responded to the scene of the shooting, including two helicopters with snipers aboard.\n\nNorris said the shooter used a high-powered sporting rifle to fire rapidly at first responders, with law enforcement initially unsure of the number of perpetrators involved. \n\nNorris would not provide more details on weapons recovered, saying officers would likely find more guns at the scene on Monday, once the fire was extinguished.\n\nFirefighters came under fire almost immediately upon arriving at the scene and did not know where the gunfire was coming from.\n\nThe suspect was found using cell phone location information and his body was removed by a SWAT team as the fire approached.\n\nVideo showed smoke billowing from heavily wooded hillsides and armed responders preparing, while several ambulances and emergency vehicles were seen entering a nearby hospital.\n\n“FBI technical teams and tactical assets are currently on the scene providing support,” FBI deputy director Dan Bongino wrote on X.\n\nFirefighters received the first call of a fire at around 1:21pm Sunday local time (6:21am Monday AEST), and about 40 minutes later, reports emerged that they were being shot at, Norris said.\n\n“This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters,” Idaho governor Brad Little said on X. “I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more.”\n\nGun ownership is widespread in the US, where the constitution protects the rights of Americans to “keep and bear arms”.",

         "The 2025 NBA free agency period doesn’t officially begin until Monday, but several teams have already agreed in principle to new contracts with their own free agents as permitted by the league’s CBA. But as of Sunday evening, a surprising name hit the free agent market. The Portland Trail Blazers agreed to a contract buyout with Deandre Ayton, as per Shams Charania of ESPN, and he immediately becomes the top center on the market, and one the Los Angeles Lakers would be wise to pursue in free agency.\nThe Lakers’ need for frontcourt depth is well-chronicled, and it’s reportedly caused potential trade partners to play hardball with the Lakers given their precarious situation.\nIn the months after the Lakers were eliminated by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the NBA playoffs, the usual suspects popped up in terms of trade targets. Walker Kessler, Robert Williams III, Daniel Gafford, Nicolas Claxton, among others. With not much to spend in terms of cap room, and a uninspiring free agent market, a trade always seemed the likely avenue for the team to acquire a starting center.\nBut with the Blazers shocking move, the Lakers have an opportunity to grab a starting caliber center without having to give anything up. They have the taxpayer mid-level exception worth around $5.7 million at their disposal, and Ayton should be the top target without question.\nLakers should purse Deandre Ayton in free agency\nPrior to Sunday, the Lakers most likely would have sued the TMLE on a backup center. Names that had been floated around were Brook Lopez and Clint Capela. But those names need to be tabled for the moment with all-in pursuit of Ayton.\nAyton’s career hasn’t quite gone as expected after the Phoenix Suns made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. Following a top-three finish in the 2019 Rookie of the Year race, his career has sort of been underwhelming so to speak. His availability has played a role in that, with him only playing an average 55 games per year over the past four seasons.\nBut there’s no question that Ayton has proven that he is a gifted scorer in the NBA. He holds career averages of 16.4 points and 59 percent shooting across his seven seasons. He is a strong presence on the glass, averaging double digits in rebounding every season of his career.\nAyton is mobile and a lob threat, something that is a requirement playing alongside Luka Doncic. And perhaps one factor that could potentially give the Lakers a leg up in pursuing him? Ayton and Doncic share the same agent in Bill Duffy.\nWith the exception of seven games during his first two seasons, Ayton has been a starting center. The Lakers front office was officially put on the clock following comments made by LeBron James’ agent Rich Paul amid James opting into his contract for next season.\nThe Lakers will certainly have competition from other teams should they enter the race to sign Ayton. His talent is undeniable. But the Lakers offer him a situation much to his advantage. One, he gets a prime opportunity to boost his stock again with plenty of minutes available at center. Two, he gets to play alongside perhaps the absolute best running mate for a big man in Doncic. And three, the Lakers need to be in win-now mode as laid out by James and Paul.\nPlaying on a winning team making a big impact is exactly what Ayton needs. And the Lakers are certainly in need of his talent.",

         "The Portland Trail Blazers made a big and surprising move before free agency begins, as they came to an agreement on a buyout with one of their centers, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.\n“Breaking: Deandre Ayton is finalizing a contract buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers to become a free agent, sources tell ESPN,” Charania wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n“Sudden addition to the free-agent market. This gives Ayton, a former No. 1 overall pick who went to the NBA Finals with the Suns, the chance to receive a fresh opportunity as the Trail Blazers build around their depth of young centers,” Charania continued.\nIt will be interesting to see what Ayton’s market will be as free agency is on the way.\nThere were many questions on how the Blazers would handle their center rotation, especially after drafting Hansen Yang with the No. 16 pick in the NBA Draft. Not many people expected Yang to go that quickly in the draft, but the Blazers believed in his talent. In his two seasons with the Chinese Basketball Association, Yang averaged 15.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks while shooting 56.9 percent from the field.\nThe Blazers had four centers on the roster, which included Ayton, Donovan Clingan, and Robert Williams III. There was a good chance someone would be on the outside looking in, and it was Ayton whom the Blazers decided to let go.\nAyton’s game has been under a microscope over the past few seasons, and it started during his final season with the Phoenix Suns. Since coming to the Trail Blazers, Ayton hadn’t been available to play much, which gave other players on the team a chance to get minutes.\nIn Clingan’s rookie season last year, he took advantage of the opportunity, and he averaged 6.5 points and 7.9 rebounds in 67 games.\nAyton will most likely have a list of suitors going after him, and he may be signed sooner rather than later.",

         "Mini Crossword\n\nThe NYT Mini is a quick and dirty version of the newspaper's larger and long-running crossword. Most days, there are between three and five clues in each direction on a five by five grid, but the puzzles are sometimes larger, especially on Saturdays.\n\nUnlike its larger sibling, the NYT Mini crossword is free to play on the New York Times website or NYT Games app. However, you’ll need an NYT Games subscription to access previous puzzles in the archives.\n\nThe NYT Mini is a fun daily distraction that usually takes no time at all. I try to beat the standard weekday grid in less than a minute. But sometimes I can't quite figure out one or two clues and need to reveal the answer.\n\nTo help you avoid doing that, here are the NYT Mini Crossword answers (spoilers lie ahead, of course):\n\nNYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers\n\n1) Something made of gold or onion - RING\n\n5) Title for a Mideast ruler - EMIR\n\n6) \"Jeopardy!\" round with just one clue - FINAL\n\n8) ___ baby - NEPO\n\n9) Competed in Pictionary - DREW\n\nPlay Puzzles & Games on Forbes\n\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes™\n\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\n\nPinpoint By Linkedin\n\nGuess The Category\n\nQueens By Linkedin\n\nCrown Each Region\n\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\n\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\n\n1) Soccer official - REF\n\n2) \"Yeah, that bothers me\" IMIND\n\n3) San Francisco football player, informally - NINER\n\n4) Flavor of purple Skittles - GRAPE\n\n7) Flo Rida hit with the lyric \"Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur\" - LOW\n\nNot that bad of a puzzle today if you ask me. Starting with Ref was pretty easy and I mean, what other flavor is a purple skittle going to be? Plum? The blank baby clue could have been literally anything, but nepo baby is such a common thing now that I picked that up after one letter. Then, it was Final Jeopardy. No literally, that was the last clue I did. Not great.\n\non TwitterYouTube, Instagram\n\nHerokiller series The Earthborn Trilogy.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions",

You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot.\nYour second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path.\nAfter that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS).\nIf you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above.\nOriginally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.\n\nKerry Brunskill\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nContributing Writer\n\nWhen baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the daily Wordle puzzle to give readers a hint each and every day.

         "The Bruins have taken care of an important bit of in-house business before the start of free agency on Tuesday.\n\nThe B’s inked Morgan Geekie to a six-year deal with an average annual value of $5.5 million late Sunday night.\n\nThat’s solid value for a player who broke out in one of the few success stories of the 2024-25 Bruins season, exploding for a 33-goal season while skating with David Pastrnak. He finished second on the team with 57 points.\n\nWhile some have questioned whether Geekie can replicate that kind of goal scoring because of his unusually high shooting percentage (22%), he does have an excellent shot, both a wrister and one-time slap shot. After notching a career-high in goals with 17 in his first season with the Bruins in 2023-24, he caught fire after Thanksgiving last season after a very slow start that saw him as a healthy scratch several times early in the season.\n\nThe Geekie signing could turn out to be one of the great finds of GM Don Sweeney’s tenure. Just two summers ago, he was cast aside by the Seattle Kraken, who did not tender him a qualifying offer, thus making him an unrestricted free agent. The B’s scooped him up with a two-year deal worth $2 million per season.\n\nLess than a week ago, it appeared as though this negotiation might take a while. Last Wednesday, Sweeney said that the two sides were not close to a deal. But things happen fast this time of year. Geekie was scheduled to be a restricted free agent and thus could have been exposed to an offer sheet, which no doubt played a part in pushing to get this done before the start of free agency on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to puckpedia.com, the breakdown of the deal is as follows: Year 1, $2.75 million base salary, $2.5 million signing bonus; Year 2, $4 million base $2.5 million signing bonus and a no-trade clause kicks in; Year 3, $4.5 million base, $2 million signing bonus, 17-team NTC; Year 4, $4.5 million base, $1 million bonus, 12-team NTC; Year 5, $5 million base, 6-team NTC; Year 6, $4.25 million.\n\nThere is also late word that RFA John Beecher, the B’s first-round pick in 2019 (30th overall), will also return for at least another year, though the details of his deal are not yet known.",

         "The Boston Bruins have re-signed pending restricted free agent Morgan Geekie to a six-year contract carrying an average annual value of $5,500,000.\n\nGeekie, 26, found his landing spot with the Bruins in the 2023 offseason as an unrestricted free agent after the Seattle Kraken did not tender him a qualifying offer. He signed a two-year contract on July 1st, 2023, worth $2,000,000 annually.\n\nDrafted in the third round (67th overall) by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, Geekie found himself splitting time between the American Hockey League (AHL) and the National Hockey League (NHL) throughout his first three seasons.\n\nHe would go on to be a part of the Charlotte Checkers, who won the 2019 AHL Calder Cup, and spend the following season with Charlotte before finally getting a look in the NHL.\n\nGeekie was one of the expansion draft selections by the Seattle Kraken, and he seemed to find his footing as a bottom-six forward. However, Seattle chose not to extend him a qualifying offer, and he found his current landing spot with the Boston Bruins, consistently posting career highs.\n\nIn the 2024-25 season, Geekie posted career highs in games played (77), goals (33), assists (24), and points (57). To date, Geekie’s posted 159 points (72G, 87A) in 333 career NHL games. He’s also suited up for 37 career playoff games, posting 10 points (6G,4A) in that time.\n\nBefore Geekie’s professional career, he played two games of Junior A hockey for the Neepawa Natives of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) and five seasons of Major Junior hockey for the Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League.\n\nThe Strathclair, Manitoba-born center will look to build off his strong season with the Boston Bruins. Geekie will be 32 when the contract expires at the end of the 2030-31 season.\n\nLocking up Geekie long-term adds to the center depth the Bruins are building, and also shows the commitment level the team has in the player and vice versa. Geekie outperformed his previous contract and is more than deserving of his current deal.\n\nThis was Morgan Geekie’s final year as an RFA, giving the Bruins five years of club control with the agreement. General Manager Don Sweeney will utilize the remaining $16.6 million in cap space to fill other needs as the Bruins eye another playoff appearance after missing the postseason for the first time since the 2015-16 season.",

With it, Geekie also registered 22 penalty minutes and a plus-three rating.\n\nOriginally chosen by the Carolina Hurricanes in the third round of the 2017 NHL Draft, the 26-year-old native of Strathclair, Man., has since skated in 333 career contests with the Hurricanes, Seattle Kraken, and Bruins in which he has tallied 72 goals and 87 assists for 159 points. In two seasons with the Bruins, Geekie has posted back-to-back career-best showings, counting 39 points in 2023-24 and last year’s 57-point effort. Geekie’s career stat line also counts six goals and four assists for 10 points through 37 outings in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nPer PuckPedia, Geekie was in the final year of a two-year pact worth $2 million per season. Geekie originally joined the Bruins in the 2023 offseason as an unrestricted free agent after he did not receive a qualifying offer from the Kraken.\n\nBeyond his success in the NHL, Geekie has also skated in part of three seasons in the AHL where through 130 career contests he has collected 45 goals and 48 assists for 93 points, underscored by a Calder Cup win with the Charlotte Checkers during the 2018-19 campaign where en route to the championship he put up eight goals and 10 assists for 18 points in 19 playoff outings.\n\nGeekie rejoins a Bruins squad that closed out the 2024-25 season second-to-last in the Eastern Conference with a 33-39-10 record and 75 points, marking the first time since 2016 in which the club did not qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.",

The vastly experienced 38-year-old has reached the third round on seven occasions and has a wonderful single-handed backhand and slice that sticks low to the grass and prevents opponents from getting on top of the ball and hitting through the court. He troubled Andy Murray at SW19 a few years ago and will hope to get inside Alcaraz's head.\nAlcaraz could have been forgiven for a slow start to the grass court season after his stunning French Open exertions but the Spaniard won Queen's as he goes for a hat-trick of Wimbledon titles. The 22-year-old knows how it feels to open Center Court on the tournament's opening day and will want to put on a show against a man he's beaten in their two previous meetings.

It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices.

         "June 30 (UPI) -- Two people were shot Sunday night near the Stonewall Inn during New York City's Pride celebrations, according to reports.\n\nSgt. Matthew Forsythe of the New York Police Department told The New York Times that the shooting occurred near the iconic LGBTQ landmark in Greenwich Village at 10:15 p.m. EDT. An unnamed NYPD spokesperson identified the victims to NBC News as a 16-year-old girl and a 17-year-old girl.\n\nThe 16-year-old suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was in critical condition, while the 17-year-old was shot in the leg and was in stable condition, according to the spokesperson.\n\nNo suspect has been identified.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said on X that he was \"saddened\" to learn of the shooting.\n\n\"During a time when our city should be rejoicing and celebrating members of our diverse LGBTQ+ community, incidents like this are devastating,\" he said.\n\n\"We're praying for the speedy recovery of the victims in tonight's shooting. The NYPD will work quickly and tirelessly to bring the suspect to justice.\"\n\nThe Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, is where in the early hours of June 28, 1969, police conducted a raid, sparking what is now known as the Stonewall riots, marking for many in the LGBTQ community, a pivotal turning point in their struggle for rights and acceptance.\n\nThe annual NYC Pride March honors that event. The Sunday night shooting occurred after the march and as celebrations were winding down.\n\nThe Christopher Street Project, a transgender advocacy group, mourned the violence in a statement, while demanding \"accountability for the hateful rhetoric that fuels attacks on queer and trans lives.\"\n\n\"Tonight, we are holding the victims of the shooting outside the Stonewall Inn and their families in our hearts,\" the organization said.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the shooting were not clear as of Monday morning and remained under police investigation.",

ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS FLOATS AT NEW YORK PRIDE PARADE, BLOCK PARADE ROUTE Responding officers found a 16-year-old female who’d sustained a gunshot wound to the head.

She was transported to Northwell Greenwich Village Hospital in Stable Condition. Police said no suspects have been arrested in the shooting. Located in the heart of Greenwich Village, the Stonewall Inn is famed for a 1969 police raid that is widely considered to have birthed the modern LGBTQ rights movement. Sunday night’s violence came just after thousands marched through the West Village in celebration of Pride Month. Hours earlier, another Pride celebration at Washing Square Park descended into chaos after a false report of gunfire and an individual deploying bear spray into a crowd sparked a stampede of people running for their lives.

         "Tarik Skubal limited Minnesota to one hit in seven innings and tied his career high with 13 strikeouts as the host Detroit Tigers blanked the Twins 3-0 on Sunday night.\n\nSkubal (10-2). who won all five of his June starts, struck out seven batters in a row from the first through the third inning. The left-hander, the American League Cy Young Award winner in 2024, is 8-0 in 10 home starts this season.\n\nWill Vest got the last three outs for his 13th save.\n\nKerry Carpenter had a solo homer and RBI triple before leaving the contest in the fifth due to right hamstring tightness. Riley Greene supplied a solo shot.\n\nMinnesota starter Chris Paddack (3-7) gave up three runs and six hits with no walks and three strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the first on Carpenter's 16th homer. He blasted a 3-2 changeup from Paddack over the right field wall.\n\nRyan Jeffers, the Twins' No. 2 hitter, hit a routine fly ball to center. Skubal struck out everyone else in his first time through the order.\n\nJavier Baez led off the bottom of the third with a double and moved to third on a long flyout. Carpenter was retired on a fly ball to leave Baez stranded.\n\nByron Buxton flied out leading off the fourth, snapping Skubal's strikeout streak.\n\nGreene then staked Skubal to a two-run lead by leading off the bottom of the inning with his 19th homer. Like Carpenter, he hit a 3-2 offering over the right field wall.\n\nTy France became the first Minnesota baserunner when he smacked a single to right with one out in the fifth inning. Skubal responded by striking out the next two batters.\n\nDetroit added a run in the fifth.

Skubal has won every outing of the month, going 5-0 and recording 39 strikeouts. \n\n Giving Skubal all the support he needed, right fielder Kerry Carpenter blasted a solo shot for his 16th home run in the first inning.

         "A near-flawless display on the mound by Tarik Skubal powered the Detroit Tigers to a 3-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Sunday night, as the ace carved up the lineup with a one-hit, 13-strikeout gem at Comerica Park, becoming the first pitcher in Tigers history to do so.\nSkubal struck out 13 batters over seven scoreless innings in front of a sellout crowd and a national audience on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball. This tied his career high, and he generated a staggering 22 swings and misses, 15 of which came off his devastating changeup. He threw 93 pitches, 67 for strikes, and allowed just one hit and one walk. He struck out every hitter in the Twins’ starting lineup, including Carlos Correa, Ty France, and Harrison Bader.\nThe left-hander opened the game by striking out eight of the first nine batters. This included a stretch of seven consecutive punchouts, marking the ninth time he’s fanned five or more through the first two innings. Skubal was perfect through three innings and struck out the side in the third. He capped off his outing with a 99.7 mph fastball that froze France for a called third strike.\nTarik Skubal’s performance certainly added to an already dominant 2025 campaign. He entered the game with a 9-2 record, 2.29 ERA, 125 strikeouts (4th in MLB), and an MLB-best 0.87 WHIP. With this win, he improved to 10-2 on the season, recording his 10th straight win, the longest active streak in MLB. He also became only the third Tigers pitcher, joining Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, to post a 5-0 or better record in June. Furthermore, he extended his home win streak at Comerica Park to 10 games. This is the franchise’s longest since David Wells in the mid-1990s.\nOffensively, Kerry Carpenter provided early support with his 16th home run of the season, launching a 3-2 changeup into the right-field seats in the first inning. Carpenter added an RBI triple in the fifth, scoring Colt Keith. However, he was removed from the game after appearing to aggravate a lingering hamstring injury. Riley Greene contributed with his 19th home run of the year, leading off the fifth with another homer off Twins starter Chris Paddack.\nThe Tigers improved to 53-32 with the win, having won 19 of 27 series and holding a 30-14 record at home. Detroit’s bullpen sealed the shutout, with Tommy Kahnle and Will Vest each tossing a scoreless inning and Vest earning his 13th save of the season.\nDetroit now heads into a six-game road trip beginning Tuesday against the Washington Nationals.",
